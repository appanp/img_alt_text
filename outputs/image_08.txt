This image (from left to right) start with the words  "start state" and right below is double circle with "0" inside of it.  A line with an arrow goes from the double  circle with "0" inside to a single circle with "1" inside. A line with an arrow goes from the single circle with a "1" inside to a single circle with a "2" inside.  Three dots  indicate the pattern continues until a single circle with a  "99" inside. This circle then goes to an elipse with "overflow"  inside.  The elipse has a circlular arrow pattern above it pointing  back to the elipse.
