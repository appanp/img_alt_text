In the image, there are four levels arranged vertically with a tree breakdown of the paths available. The first level labeled "start" is blue and has a solid red line with an arrow going to "a=0"  which is blue in the second level.  The first level labeled "start" also has a dotted purple line with  an arrow labeled "1" going to the same "a=0" which is blue in the second level.  The first level labeled  "start" has a black line with an arrow going to the second level labeled "a=1" which is blue in the  second level. The "a=0" has a dotted purple line with an arrow labeled as "2" going to a blue "c=0" in the fourth level. The "a=0" also has a black line with an arrow going to the same blue "b=0" in the third level. The "a=0" has a dotted purple line with an arrow labeled as "4" going to a blue "c=0" in the fourth level. The "a=0" also has a black line with an arrow going to the same blue "b=1" in the third level. The "a=0" has a dotted purple line with an arrow labeled as "6" going to a red "c=0/0" in the fourth level. The "a=0" also has a red line with an arrow going to the same blue "b=2" in the third level. The "a=1" has three black lines with arrows going to the third level labeled as "b=0", "b=1", and "b=2". The "b=0" that came from "a=0" has a black line going to the fourth level labeled as "c=0" with a green check mark below it.  This "c=0" has a dotted purple line labeled as "3" going back to "a=0". The "b=1" that came from "a=0" has a black line going to the fourth level labeled as "c=0" with a green check mark below it.  This "c=0" has a dotted purple line labeled as "5" going back to "a=0". The "b=2" that came from "a=0" has a black line going to the fourth level labeled as "c=0/0" which is red with an red  x below it.  The "b=0" that came from "a=1" has a black line going to the fourth level labeled as "c=-1". The "b=1" that came from "a=1" has a black line going to the fourth level labeled as "c=1/0". The "b=2" that came from "a=1" has a black line going to the fourth level labeled as "c=1".
