The image has two parts.  The left part is a tree breakdown showing paths for values of  variables.  The right part contains programming code that correspond to the variables. There are four levels arranged verticially in both the left and right part with the values corresponding directly between the levels in the parts.  Starting with the right part, the first level is labeled  as 1 and has the code "Random random = new Random()".  The second level is labeled as 2 and  has the code "int a = random.nextInt(2)".  The third level is labeled as 3 and has the code  "int b = random.nextInt(3)".  The fourth level is labled as 4 and has the code "int c = a/(b+a - 2)". For the left part, the top of the tree in level 1 is labeled "start".  It has two lines with arrows  to the second level.  These endpoints are labeled "a=0" and "a=1".  Starting on the second level  with the point labeled "a=0" then it has three lines with arrows going to the third level. These endpoints are labeled "b=0", "b=1", and "b=2".  The endpoint on level 2 labeled "a=1"  has three lines with arrows going to the third level.  These endpoints are labeled "b=0", "b=1",  and "b=2".  Starting on level 3,  the endpoint marked "b=0" which comes from "a=0" has a line with an arrow going to "c=0" the endpoint marked "b=1" which comes from "a=0" has a line with an arrow going to "c=0" the endpoint marked "b=2" which comes from "a=0" has a line with an arrow going to "c=0/0" the endpoint marked "b=0" which comes from "a=1" has a line with an arrow going to "c=-1" the endpoint marked "b=1" which comes from "a=1" has a line with an arrow going to "c=1/0" the endpoint marked "b=2" which comes from "a=1" has a line with an arrow going to "c=1" The path "start" going to "a=1" going to "b=0" going to "c=-1" is in red with a green checkmark below it.
