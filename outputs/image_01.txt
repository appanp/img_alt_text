Image has three main parts: 1) three circles on the left side with arrows between them, 2) a  breakdown with boxes on the right side, and 3) reference information on the bottom.  On the  first part, there are three circles labeled S0, S1, and S2.  From the circle S0, there are  arrows to S1 and S2.  From the circle S1 there is one arrow to S0.  From the circle S2 there  is one arrow to S1.  From the first part, there is a bigger arrow over to the boxes on the  right side.  The boxes are a hierarchical break down.  The top box is labeled S0, it has lines  breaking down to S1 (left side) and S2 (right side).  From S1 on the left side, it has a line breaking down to S0.  From S0, it has a  line breaking down to S1 and S2.  S1 and S2 both have a line breaking down to the symbol three vertical  dots.  From S2 on the right side, it breaks down to S1 which breaks down to S0 which breaks down to a box with symbol three vertical dots.  The reference at the bottom reads "Source:  E.M. Clarke, E.A. Emerson, A.P. Sistla, Automatic Verification of Finite-State Concurrent Systems Using Temporal Logic Specification, ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, Vol. 8, No. 2, April 1986".  Below this, it reads "Figure 1 A three-state automation with  the corresponding tree".
